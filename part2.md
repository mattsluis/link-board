#Linkboard Part 2

To finish up the Link Board assignment, implement **at least 5 of the following:**

* Add comments
* Add voting to comments
* Use models for auth
* Use models for adding posts or comments
* Add AJAX Delete to comments
* Change the color scheme/styling using SASS
* Add User Profile page
* Display vote counts
* display comment counts

## Voting

Since we already have a polymorphic vote model now we just need to associate votes to comments (same as associating them to posts). Users should be able to up / down vote comments just like they can on posts.
